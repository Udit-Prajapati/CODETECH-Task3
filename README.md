# Overview:
This project involves designing and implementing a relational database for an online retail store. The database manages products, customers, orders, and payments, enabling efficient handling of customer orders, payment processing, and inventory management. The schema was developed to ensure data integrity using primary and foreign keys, and transactions were demonstrated using realistic queries.

# Key Activities:
Database Creation:
Designed and implemented a database schema for the online retail store, including tables for Products, Customers, Orders, Order_Items, and Payments.
Data Population:
Populated the database with sample data, including product details, customer information, and an order with associated items and payment records.
Query Execution:
Executed SQL queries for various operations like placing orders, updating stock quantities, processing payments, and retrieving order and product information.
Data Updates:
Demonstrated dynamic updates for stock quantities, payment statuses, and order details based on transactions.
Data Retrieval:
Retrieved and analyzed key data like order history, payment details, and available products through advanced SQL queries using joins and conditions.

# Queries and Updates:
Customer Order Handling:
Inserted order records and associated items into the database.
Adjusted stock quantities dynamically based on orders placed.
Payment Processing:
Recorded payment details and updated payment statuses to reflect transaction results.
Data Analysis Queries:
Retrieved order details, payment statuses, and associated product details for specific customers.
Queried product availability to display inventory details.
Retrieved order history for customers in chronological order.

# Technology Used:
Database Management System: MySQL
SQL Features:
Data Definition Language (DDL) for table creation.
Data Manipulation Language (DML) for data insertion, updates, and retrieval.
Constraints for maintaining data integrity (e.g., primary keys, foreign keys).
Calculated fields and joins for complex queries.

# Key Insights:
Efficient Schema Design:
Proper normalization ensured minimal redundancy and logical relationships between tables, facilitating easy data management.
Transaction Demonstration:
Real-world operations like inventory updates and payment processing were efficiently handled, showcasing practical applications.
Data Integrity and Accuracy:
Constraints like foreign keys and auto-calculated fields (e.g., total price) ensured consistent and accurate data.
Advanced Querying Techniques:
Joins and filters enabled meaningful insights, such as order history and stock availability, demonstrating the database's ability to support business operations.
Scalability Potential:
The modular design supports scalability for future enhancements like adding new product categories, more detailed payment tracking, or integrating user-specific features.
